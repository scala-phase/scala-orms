# The Scala Query ORM

From *scalaquery.org*:

- ScalaQuery is "an API / DSL built on top of JDBC".
- Designed with the following goals in mind:
    * A Scala API for database access
    * Compile-time checking and type-safety of database queries
    * Composable, non-leaky abstractions, using a relational algebra and
      query comprehensions, providing an abstraction that can be composed
      similarly to what you can do with Scala's collection classes.
